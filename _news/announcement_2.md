ðŸŽ‰ **Exciting milestones at TMS Annual Meeting 2025 â€“ Las Vegas!**

Iâ€™m honored to have been **elected as the JOM Advisor-in-Training** for the [TMS Magnesium Committee](https://www.tms.org/portal/portal/Divisions___Committees/Divisions___Committees/Light_Metals_Division/Magnesium_Committee/home.aspx), with over 67% of votes cast in support. My sincere thanks to outgoing Chair **Dr. Domonkos Tolnai** for his mentorship and warm encouragement, and congratulations to the incoming leadership **Dr. Aaron Palumbo (Chair)** and **Dr. BjÃ¶rn Wiese (Vice Chair)**.

ðŸ”¬ I also presented our **NSF-funded research** on  
**"Vacancy-Induced Solute Clustering in Magnesium Alloys"**  
â€” a collaboration between the **Weihs Group (JHU)**, **Arun Devarajâ€™s group at PNNL**, and **Michael Falkâ€™s group at JHU**. Special appreciation to **Jack Grimm**, **Dr. Francelia Sanchez**, and **Homero Reyes Pulido** for their contributions. The talk received strong engagement and sparked productive discussions around vacancy mechanisms in light metals.

ðŸ“¢ Additionally, my advisor **Prof. Tim Weihs** presented our joint work on  
**"Machine Learning-Guided Alloy Design for Biodegradable Magnesium Implants"**  
in collaboration with **Adam Griebel (Fort Wayne Metals)**, **Prof. Maitreyee Sharma Priyadarshini (Virginia Tech)**, and **Prof. Paulette Clancy (JHU ChemBE)**.

Grateful to the **TMS Functional Materials Division** for supporting my participation through a competitive **travel grant**.
