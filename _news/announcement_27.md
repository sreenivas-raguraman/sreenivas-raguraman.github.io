📢 **New Preprint Alert**

Sreenivas’ latest collaborative paper has been submitted to arXiv, titled:  
**“Machine Learning–Assisted Analysis of Combustion and Ignition in As-milled and Annealed Al/Zr Composite Powders”**

🔗 [Read the preprint](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.06364)

### 🔥 The Core Idea  
Micron-scale Al/Zr metal composites are highly promising for energetic applications, but the **mechanistic understanding of ignition and combustion** remains incomplete—especially after annealing.

This study bridges the gap by combining **high-speed hyperspectral imaging** with **machine learning** to decode particle-level ignition thresholds and combustion patterns.

---

### 🛠️ Methodology in Focus  
The team:
- Synthesized **Al-Zr powders (3Al:Zr, Al:Zr, Al:3Zr)** via ball milling  
- Performed **argon annealing up to 1000 °C** to trigger partial reaction pathways  
- Used a **hot wire method** to ignite powders in diverse atmospheres  
- Captured **single-particle burn behaviors** via high-speed imaging  
- Developed a **CNN-based model** to quantify **microexplosion frequency** and correlate it with composition and thermal history

---

### 🌡️ Key Insights  
- 🔥 **Al-rich powders** show **lower ignition thresholds** but are more sensitive to annealing  
- ⚙️ **Zr-rich powders** are less affected by heat loss during annealing due to oxidation-assisted ignition  
- 📈 **Combustion temperatures increased significantly** (by **100–400 K**) post-annealing  
- 💥 Despite heat removal, **microexplosions remained >46% frequent**, indicating strong combustion stability

---

### 🧠 Why It Matters  
By integrating **convolutional neural networks** with energetic materials testing, this work offers a **new paradigm** for predicting combustion thresholds. This could enable:
- Safer, more efficient **propellant design**  
- Real-time diagnostics in **explosive safety testing**  
- Tailored **annealing schedules** to engineer desired burn characteristics

---

### 🤝 Collaboration & Vision  
This effort reflects a deep collaboration between experimental combustion science and data-driven modeling, led by **Michael R. Flickinger**, with contributions from  
**Sreenivas Raguraman**, **Mark A. Foster**, **Timothy P. Weihs**, and others.

> It paves the way for smarter material design by quantifying how **microscale ignition dynamics** evolve with heat treatment—a step toward predictive synthesis in energetic systems.
