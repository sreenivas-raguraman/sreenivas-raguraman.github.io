🧪 **New Publication Alert**  

Sreenivas’ latest paper has been published in the *Journal of the Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (JOM)*, titled:  
**“Evaluating In-Vitro Corrosion Testing of ECAP-Processed Lean Magnesium Alloys: The Critical Role of Degradation Media Composition, Buffering, and Volume”**

### 🧭 The Big Idea  
Biodegradable magnesium alloys are promising for orthopedic implants, but their **corrosion rate is highly sensitive to testing conditions**. This paper highlights why we must **rethink standard in-vitro testing protocols** that use fixed media and volumes.

---

### 🔧 What We Did  
We investigated a **lean Mg-Zn-Ca alloy** processed via ECAP and evaluated how **degradation media**, **buffering strategy**, and **solution volume** affect its corrosion behavior. Three widely used media were tested:

- **HBSS** (with/without CO₂)  
- **EBSS**  
- **DMEM + 10% FBS**  

We also tested **media volume effects** and **CO₂ buffering in HBSS**, all under ASTM G31 standards.

---

### 🌟 Key Findings  
- **Corrosion rate is not fixed** — it varies dramatically with test media  
- **CO₂ buffering in HBSS** lowers corrosion and mimics physiological pH  
- **DMEM + 10% FBS** offers the most realistic in-vitro environment  
- Larger **solution volumes** reduce pH swings and stabilize corrosion rate  
- ASTM standards may need revision for **biodegradable Mg testing**

---

### 🔬 Why It Matters  
This study shows that **test setup matters just as much as alloy chemistry**. Without proper control over volume and buffering, test results may **mislead implant designers**. Our work offers clear **guidance for optimizing test protocols** that better reflect in-vivo behavior.

> A step toward more meaningful corrosion data—and safer, more reliable magnesium implants.

### 🤝 Collaboration & Impact  
This work involved researchers from **Johns Hopkins University** and **Fort Wayne Metals**, pushing forward the clinical readiness of magnesium biomaterials.
