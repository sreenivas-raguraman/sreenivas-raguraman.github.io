I’m a Ph.D. candidate in **Materials Science & Engineering** at **Johns Hopkins University**, where I engineer **microstructures and defect landscapes** to optimize **mechanical performance**, **corrosion resistance**, and **biocompatibility**.  

My research integrates **materials processing**, **thermomechanical design**, and **advanced characterization** techniques (APT, PAS, SEM, XRD, TEM), enabling materials-by-design approaches tailored for both **biomedical** and **structural** systems. Whether it’s improving implant reliability or enabling high-strength alloys for extreme environments, my goal is to bridge **fundamental mechanisms** with **application-driven performance metrics**.

I’ve built cross-disciplinary collaborations with **machine learning researchers** (for predictive alloy design), **computational scientists** (to probe thermodynamics and kinetics), and **in vivo testing teams** (to understand material–biological interactions). My experience spans **academia**, **industry**, and **national labs**, empowering me to translate ideas into impact — swiftly and cost-effectively.

In the long term, I aim to lead a research group that builds functional materials **from principles to performance** — across **biomedical**, **aerospace**, and **energy-relevant** applications.
