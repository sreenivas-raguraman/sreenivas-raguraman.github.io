I am a researcher in **Department of Materials Science & Engineering** at **Johns Hopkins University**, where I earned my **M.S. and am currently pursuing a Ph.D.**, advised by [Prof. Timothy P. Weihs](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/timothy-weihs/). I am also a visiting researcher at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and a Foreign Guest Researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. I specialize in **engineering microstructures and defect landscapes** to enhance **mechanical performance**, **corrosion resistance**, and **biocompatibility** across biomedical, structural, and reactive materials. 

My research integrates **materials processing**, **thermomechanical design**, and **advanced characterization** techniques (APT, PAS, SEM, XRD, TEM), enabling materials-by-design approaches tailored for both **biomedical** and **structural** systems. Whether itâ€™s improving implant reliability or enabling high-strength alloys for extreme environments, my goal is to bridge **fundamental mechanisms** with **application-driven performance metrics**.

Iâ€™ve built cross-disciplinary collaborations with **machine learning researchers** (for predictive alloy design), **computational scientists** (to probe thermodynamics and kinetics), and **in vivo testing teams** (to understand materialâ€“biological interactions). My experience spans **academia**, **industry**, and **national labs**, empowering me to translate ideas into impact swiftly and cost-effectively.

I am currently a **visiting researcher** at both **NIST** and **PNNL**, and earned my Bachelor of Technology in **Metallurgical and Materials Engineering** from **NIT Trichy**. During internships at the **National University of Singapore** and **IISc Bangalore**, I worked on magnesium-based biomaterials and recrystallization behavior in light metals.

In the long term, I aim to be a Professor and lead a research group that builds functional materials **from principles to performance** â€” across **biomedical**, **aerospace**, and **energy-relevant** applications.
