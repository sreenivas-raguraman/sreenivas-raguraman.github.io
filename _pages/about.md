I am a Ph.D. candidate in Materials Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, researching magnesium alloys for structural and biomedical applications. Under the guidance of Prof. Timothy P. Weihs, I focus on the effect of thermomechanical processing on mechanical behavior and corrosion resistance, integrating mechanical testing, immersion-based degradation studies, and microstructural analysis to develop process-structure-property relationships.

My work spans institutions like NIST and PNNL, where I use advanced characterization techniques such as Atom Probe Tomography (APT) and Focused Ion Beam (FIB) to study vacancy-induced solute clustering in Mg alloys. I often collaborate with computational researchers to integrate machine learning and modeling into alloy design.

Prior to my Ph.D., I conducted research at IISc and NUS, gaining experience in titanium and magnesium alloys, which deepened my understanding of materials processing and deformation. 

Beyond research, Iâ€™ve mentored over 11 students and actively contribute to TMS communities on biomaterials, corrosion, and mechanical behavior. My interdisciplinary background across academia, national labs, and industry equips me to address complex materials challenges in lightweight and corrosion-resistant metals.
