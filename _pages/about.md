# About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in **Materials Science and Engineering** at **Johns Hopkins University**, advised by [Prof. Timothy P. Weihs](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/timothy-weihs/). My research bridges **materials processing**, **microstructural and defect engineering**, and **application-driven property optimization** across **biomedical**, **structural**, and **reactive material systems**.

My expertise lies in tailoring **grain structure**, **precipitate evolution**, and **defect populations**—including **vacancies** and **dislocations**—to control and enhance **mechanical behavior**, **corrosion resistance**, and **toxicity profiles**. I leverage advanced processing methods such as **severe plastic deformation**, **annealing**, and **cryo-quenching**, supported by multiscale characterization (APT, PAS, SEM, EBSD, XRD).

My collaborative ecosystem includes:

- **Machine Learning** experts: for data-driven processing optimization and alloy discovery  
- **Computational Thermodynamics** researchers: to understand phase evolution and vacancy behavior  
- **Biomedical engineers**: to interpret in vivo responses and material–tissue interactions  
- **National laboratories**: for atomistic analysis and property verification  
- **Industry partners**: for real-world constraints and rapid feedback

While my core focus is on **biodegradable Mg alloys** for medical applications, I also contribute to high-performance **Al-based reactive materials** for ignition systems—demonstrating versatility across functional materials. My translational mindset is supported by experience working across academia, industry (e.g., Fort Wayne Metals), and national labs (PNNL, NIST), enabling me to push **performance–cost–speed tradeoffs** at scale.
