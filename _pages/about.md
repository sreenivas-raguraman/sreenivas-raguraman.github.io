I am **Sreenivas Raguraman**, a Ph.D. candidate in **Materials Science and Engineering** at **Johns Hopkins University**.

My research focuses on the development and characterization of **biodegradable magnesium alloys** for biomedical and structural applications. I specialize in **thermomechanical processing**, **advanced microstructural characterization** (SEM, EBSD, APT, XRD), and **corrosion and mechanical testing** to optimize process-structure-property relationships in metals. I also integrate **machine learning** approaches to accelerate experimental design and materials discovery.

Through collaborations with national laboratories such as **PNNL** and **NIST**, I study **vacancy-induced solute clustering** and **degradation kinetics** in magnesium alloys. My work combines fundamental understanding with translational applications, aiming to design lightweight, corrosion-resistant metals for real-world use.

Beyond research, I am passionate about **mentoring students** and **contributing to the scientific community**. I have mentored over **10 undergraduate and master's students**, served as a **Teaching Assistant** for both undergraduate and graduate thermodynamics courses, and actively contribute to professional societies like **TMS**, including organizing symposia and reviewing for leading journals.

Prior to my Ph.D., I gained research experience at the **Indian Institute of Science (IISc)** and the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**, where I worked on titanium and magnesium alloy processing and deformation.

My interdisciplinary background across academia, national laboratories, and industry collaborations equips me to address complex challenges in materials development for structural and biomedical applications.
