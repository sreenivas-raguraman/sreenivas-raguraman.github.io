I’m a Ph.D. candidate in **Materials Science and Engineering** at **Johns Hopkins University**, advised by [Prof. Timothy P. Weihs](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/timothy-weihs/). My research focuses on processing–structure–property–performance relationships in metals for **biomedical**, **structural**, and **defense** applications.

I use advanced techniques in **materials processing** (severe plastic deformation, thermomechanical treatments) and **microstructural engineering** to design alloys with tailored performance. My work is supported by high-resolution characterization tools (APT, PAS, SEM, EBSD, XRD) and is extended through collaborations in **machine learning** and **computational materials science**.

I’ve worked across academia, national labs (PNNL, NIST), and industry (Fort Wayne Metals). My contributions have been recognized with **TMS awards**, the **Rodbell Fellowship**, and invitations to organize technical symposia and lead community efforts.

My long-term vision is to build a research group that bridges **curiosity-driven discovery** with **application-focused performance** — creating materials that function from **first principles to real-world deployment**.
