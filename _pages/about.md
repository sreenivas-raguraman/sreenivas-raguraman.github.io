I’m a Ph.D. candidate in **Materials Science and Engineering** at **Johns Hopkins University**, advised by <a href='https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/timothy-weihs/'>Prof. Timothy P. Weihs</a>. My research investigates **processing–structure–property–performance relationships** in metallic systems for both **structural** and **biomedical** applications.

At the core of my work is an experimental approach to **materials processing**, **microstructural engineering**, and **mechanism-driven design**. I specialize in techniques such as **severe plastic deformation** and **thermomechanical treatments** to tailor grain structure, phase stability, and defect populations. These efforts are supported by advanced characterization (APT, PAS, SEM, EBSD, XRD) and extended to evaluations of **mechanical behavior** and **corrosion performance**.

I collaborate with experts in **machine learning** and **computational materials science** to accelerate alloy discovery and uncover hidden processing–structure–property relationships. My work aims to bridge **fundamental understanding** with **application-driven performance targets**—whether in **biodegradable implants**, **lightweight structural alloys**, or **next-generation protective materials**.

My research spans academia, national laboratories (PNNL, NIST), and industry (Fort Wayne Metals), resulting in over **8 peer-reviewed publications**, **14+ technical presentations**, and leadership on federally funded projects, including an **NSF grant on vacancy engineering**. I have been recognized with the **Rodbell Fellowship**, multiple **TMS awards**, and invited roles such as **Discussion Leader for the GRS Physical Metallurgy** and **Symposium Organizer** for **Vacancy Engineering for Metals and Alloys** at **TMS 2026**.

Beyond the lab, I’m committed to **mentorship**, **scientific service**, and **community leadership**. I’ve mentored over **11 undergraduate, master's, and high school students**, many of whom are co-authors on my publications. I serve as **Vice President of the Materials Graduate Society**, organize national symposia (TMS, MACH, GRC/GRS), contribute as a **Co-Guest Editor for JOM**, and review for more than **four journals**.

Before my Ph.D., I conducted research at the **Indian Institute of Science (IISc)** and the **National University of Singapore (NUS)** on microstructure–processing relationships in Mg and Ti alloys.

I envision a career at the intersection of **materials processing**, **advanced characterization**, and **translational performance metrics**, with the versatility to work across biomedical, structural, and defense-relevant materials systems. My long-term goal is to lead a research group that builds materials from first principles to function, merging curiosity-driven discovery with real-world impact.
