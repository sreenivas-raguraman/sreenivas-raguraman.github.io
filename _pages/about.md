I am a Ph.D. candidate in Materials Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, specializing in the design, characterization, and testing of magnesium alloys for structural and biomedical applications. Under the guidance of Prof. Timothy P. Weihs, my research focuses on understanding the relationship between thermomechanical processing and its impact on the mechanical behavior, corrosion resistance, and degradation kinetics of Mg alloys through extensive mechanical testing, as well as immersion-based corrosion studies. By integrating these experimental techniques with advanced microstructural characterization, I aim to establish robust process-structure-property relationships that inform alloy development for diverse engineering applications, including biomedical implants, lightweight structural materials, and corrosion-resistant alloys.

My research spans internationally recognized institutions, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), where I collaborate on high-resolution microstructural and chemical analyses. I employ advanced techniques such as Focused Ion Beam (FIB) and Atom Probe Tomography (APT) to investigate vacancy-induced solute clustering in Mg alloysâ€”critical for understanding phase stability, mechanical performance, and environmental degradation. While my focus is on experimental materials science, I frequently collaborate with computational researchers who use machine learning and modeling approaches to complement experimental findings and accelerate alloy development.

Prior to my Ph.D., I gained extensive international research experience through research internships at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and the National University of Singapore (NUS). At IISc, I worked under Prof. Satyam Suwas on titanium alloys, investigating their mechanical properties and microstructural evolution. At NUS, under Prof. Manoj Gupta, I explored the processing and characterization of ultralight magnesium alloys, contributing to advances in lightweight materials for structural applications. These experiences deepened my expertise in materials processing and deformation mechanisms across a range of alloy systems.

Beyond research, I am dedicated to mentorship and professional service, having guided over 11 students and co-authored publications with mentees at various academic levels. As an active member of The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS), I contribute to discussions on metallurgy, biomaterials, mechanical behavior, and corrosion science. My interdisciplinary experience across academia, government labs, and industry positions me to tackle complex materials challenges in structural applications, corrosion-resistant materials, and extreme environment materials.
