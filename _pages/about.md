I am a **Ph.D. candidate in Materials Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University**, advised by [Prof. Timothy P. Weihs](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/timothy-weihs/). My research is rooted in experimental physical metallurgy with a strong drive to connect **processing, structure, and property relationships** across **lightweight structural**, **biomedical**, and **reactive materials**.

### 🔬 Research Philosophy

My scientific approach centers on **engineering microstructure and defects**—from **grain boundaries** to **vacancy clusters**—to realize materials that are **mechanically robust**, **biocorrosion-resistant**, and **biocompatible**. I use techniques such as **severe plastic deformation** and **thermomechanical processing** to optimize material properties through **rapid**, **cost-effective**, and **scalable** processing strategies.

My dissertation focuses on **biodegradable Mg alloys**, but I’ve also led/co-authored work on:
- Vacancy-induced solute clustering in Mg  
- Al-based reactive materials for enhanced ignition  
- In vivo aluminum toxicity mitigation  
- ML-guided alloy and process design

## 🌐 Collaborations & Impact

I thrive at the interface of academia, industry, and national labs:

- **National Labs**: PNNL (APT, PAS), NIST (alloy development, microscopy)  
- **Industry**: Fort Wayne Metals (biomedical wire systems)  
- **Academic Networks**: Virginia Tech, University of Utah, Monash University, AI-X Foundry (JHU), Washington State University Pullman  

This ecosystem accelerates my goal of turning bench-scale science into real-world solutions. Details on my team and mentorship efforts are in [Mentorship →](/mentorship/) and [Service →](/services/).
