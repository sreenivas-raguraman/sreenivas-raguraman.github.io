I am a **Ph.D. candidate in Materials Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University**, advised by [Prof. Timothy P. Weihs](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/timothy-weihs/). My research is driven by an interdisciplinary approach to **engineering microstructure and defects** to optimize materials for **application-specific performance**, spanning **biomedical**, **structural**, and **energetic material systems**.

My core scientific philosophy centers around designing materials that are **cost-effective**, **rapid to process**, and **tailored for performance**. I achieve this by tuning **grain structure**, **precipitate evolution**, and **defect populations** (e.g., vacancies, dislocations) through **thermomechanical processing**, **annealing**, **severe plastic deformation**, and **cryo-quenching**. These strategies allow precise control over **mechanical behavior**, **corrosion resistance**, and **toxicity profiles**.

### 🔬 Research Vision

I develop integrative solutions to pressing materials challenges by combining:

- **Process–Structure–Property Engineering** — from atomic-scale defects to mesoscale architecture  
- **Advanced multiscale characterization** — APT, PAS, SEM, EBSD, µCT, XRD  
- **Data-driven methods** — machine learning for processing and alloy optimization  
- **Computational thermodynamics** — modeling vacancy behavior and phase evolution  
- **In vivo experimentation** — understanding biological interactions and degradation kinetics  

Although my dissertation centers on **biodegradable magnesium alloys** for medical implants, my scope extends to **Al-based reactive materials**, **vacancy-engineered systems**, and **multiphase structural alloys**. I thrive on solving **translational materials problems**, balancing performance and manufacturability, and drawing insights from cross-disciplinary collaboration.

### 🌐 Institutional and Industrial Reach

My research is deeply collaborative, involving:

- **National Labs**: PNNL (APT, PAS) and NIST (alloy development, microscopy)  
- **Industry**: Fort Wayne Metals (biomedical wire systems)  
- **Academic Networks**: Virginia Tech, University of Utah, Monash University, and the AI-X Foundry at JHU  

These collaborations enable me to work across boundaries—bringing **design-stage science into real-world application spaces**, while adapting rapidly to experimental feedback and deployment constraints.
