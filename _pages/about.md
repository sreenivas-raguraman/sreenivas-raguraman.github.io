I am a **Ph.D. candidate in Materials Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University**, advised by [Prof. Timothy P. Weihs](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/timothy-weihs/). My research is driven by an interdisciplinary approach to **engineering microstructure and defects to optimize materials for application-specific performance**, spanning biomedical, structural, and energetic systems.

### Research Vision

I develop materials solutions by tailoring **grain size, precipitate morphology, and defect populations (e.g., vacancies, dislocations)** through **thermomechanical processing**, **annealing**, **severe plastic deformation**, and **cryo-quenching**. These approaches allow me to modulate and enhance **mechanical strength**, **biocorrosion resistance**, and **toxicity**, with an emphasis on **scalability**, **cost-efficiency**, and **processing speed**.

I have built an integrative framework that connects:

- **Fundamental process–structure–property correlations**  
- **Advanced multiscale characterization** (APT, PAS, XRD, SEM, EBSD, µCT)  
- **Computational modeling & thermodynamics**  
- **In vivo degradation and tissue response studies**  
- **Machine learning-guided optimization**  

This translational mindset enables my work to go beyond traditional "biometal" boundaries. I have led projects on **vacancy-induced solute clustering**, **ignition mechanisms in Al-based reactive materials**, and **degradation modeling of Mg alloys**, while contributing to collaborative research funded by **NSF**, **NIH**, and **DOD-aligned agencies**, though without explicitly stating such affiliations.

### Institutional and Industrial Reach

My collaborative ecosystem includes:
- **National Labs**: Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  
- **Industry**: Fort Wayne Metals, focused on deployable biomedical materials  
- **Academia**: Strong network across Johns Hopkins (MSE, ChemBE, AI-X Foundry), Virginia Tech, University of Utah, and Monash University  

These interactions allow me to work at the interface of **application-driven material science**, meeting real-world constraints while rapidly iterating on ideas from the lab bench to the design floor.
