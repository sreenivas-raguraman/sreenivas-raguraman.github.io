In this project, we develop a machine learningâ€“guided strategy to simultaneously optimize **corrosion resistance** and **hardness** in biodegradable magnesium alloys, crucial for applications such as **resorbable vascular scaffolds**.

Working with (Prof. Paulette Clancy)[https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/paulette-clancy/] from Johns Hopkins University, Prof. Maitreyee Sharma Priyadharshini](https://www.aoe.vt.edu/people/faculty/maitreyee-sharma-priyadarshini.html) at **Virginia Tech**, and [Mr. Adam Griebel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-griebel-19663717/) at **Fort Wayne Metals**, we integrate **physics-informed LASSO models** and the **PAL 2.0 Bayesian optimization framework** to uncover structureâ€“property linkages and suggest optimal processing paths.

### Goals

- **Accelerate discovery** of microstructureâ€“property relationships in Mg alloys.
- **Optimize processing parameters** (extrusion, ECAP, rolling, annealing) using Bayesian learning to minimize corrosion and maximize hardness.
- Translate laboratory discoveries to **industry-relevant processing** with Fort Wayne Metals.

### Interpretable ML with LASSO

We use **physics-based LASSO regression** to isolate key microstructural features controlling corrosion and hardnessâ€”going beyond black-box ML approaches. This work is supported by our publication:

### Establishing Corrosion Testing Standards

Given the lack of standardized corrosion protocols for biodegradable Mg alloys, we conducted a systematic evaluation of test media, buffering, and volumeâ€”essential for reliable ML training data. Our findings, published in *JOM*:

### Process Optimization with PAL 2.0

We implemented **PAL 2.0**, a physics-aware Bayesian optimization framework, to iteratively explore processing pathways and optimize the tradeoff between hardness and corrosion. Unlike brute-force design of experiments, PAL learns from each round and proposes new experiments most likely to improve the property balance.

### Preliminary Outcomes

- Structureâ€“property links revealed through LASSO show processing effects on grain size, precipitate area, and GND density dominate performance.
- PAL 2.0 suggests new conditions not initially tested that outperform original processing routes.
- Corrosion standards and testing variability have been addressed to ensure **robust training datasets** for ML models.

Results were presented at **TMS 2025**, and a comprehensive manuscript integrating ML and experimental frameworks is **in preparation**.
