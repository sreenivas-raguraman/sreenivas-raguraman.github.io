This project focuses on the **in-vitro and in-vivo degradation behavior of Mg-9Al alloys**, particularly their suitability for **biodegradable cardiovascular stents**. In collaboration with **Prof. Roger Guillory II** at the **Medical College of Wisconsin**, we evaluate **corrosion behavior, hydrogen evolution**, and **aluminum release** using a combination of electrochemical, microstructural, and biological methods.

### Objectives

- Study the degradation mechanisms of **solutionized and peak-aged Mg-9Al alloys** in vitro and in vivo.
- Monitor **hydrogen evolution** and **morphological degradation** using SEM and CT.
- Assess **aluminum release trends** to understand potential **systemic biocompatibility** risks.
- Inform microstructural design strategies to control degradation rates in bioresorbable stents.

- **In-vitro immersion testing** in simulated body fluids was performed to study **mass loss, pH changes**, and **surface morphology**, with analysis via **SEM/EDS**.
- **Aluminum release** from corroding samples was tracked over time using **ICP QQQ**, providing insights into alloy biocompatibility.
- **In-vivo studies** involved **subcutaneous implantation** in murine models, with **CT imaging** used to monitor hydrogen bubble evolution as a proxy for degradation rate.

### Key Insights

- **Peak-aged microstructures**, rich in Mg<sub>17</sub>Al<sub>12</sub>, show **accelerated corrosion** in vitro due to micro-galvanic effects.
- **Aluminum release**, though elevated in vitro, is being carefully evaluated in vivo for its systemic effects.
- **In-vivo degradation** proceeds more gradually, indicating that the biological environment buffers degradation aggressiveness.

### Ongoing Work

Current work focuses on refining thermal processing routes to minimize Al-rich precipitate formation and improve **biocompatibility** without compromising mechanical integrity. These insights are being integrated into a framework for **safer Mg-based bioresorbable devices**.
