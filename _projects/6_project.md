This project focuses on synthesizing and characterizing **ultralight magnesium-based alloys and composites**, using advanced alloying and processing routes to significantly enhance mechanical performance for structural and biomedical applications.

### Objectives

- Design **magnesium alloys with reduced density** and improved strength for lightweight applications.
- Evaluate **silica nanoparticle additions** in binary Mg-Li alloys to improve strength and ductility.
- Study **Mn addition in Mg-Zn-Ca alloys** for yield strength enhancement with minimal density increase.

### Methods

- **Synthesis**: Alloys were produced using **Disintegrated Melt Deposition (DMD)** followed by **extrusion** and **heat treatment** to optimize microstructure.
- **Characterization**:
  - **SEM** and **XRD** for analyzing microstructure and phase composition.
  - **Mechanical testing** using micro-hardness, compression, and damping behavior measurements to quantify performance enhancements.

### Key Outcomes

- **Mg-Li-SiO₂ nanocomposites**: Achieved a **65× increase in strength**, **80% fracture strain**, and **6% density reduction** compared to pure Mg.
- **Mg-Zn-Ca-Mn alloys**: **70% improvement in yield strength** with <2% density increase.
- Demonstrated potential for **high-strength, lightweight materials** for biomedical and structural applications.
