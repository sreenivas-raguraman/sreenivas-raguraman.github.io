This project was conducted during a research internship at the **Laboratory of Texture and Related Studies**, Department of Materials Engineering, **Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore**, under the guidance of **Prof. Dr. Satyam Suwas** and **Dr. Gyan Shankar**. The objective was to explore the development of crystallographic texture and mechanical property evolution in **commercial purity titanium (cp-Ti)** under cold rolling and subsequent recrystallization.

### Objectives

- Understand how deformation and annealing affect texture and hardness in cp-Ti.
- Track the stages of recrystallization and associated microstructural evolution.
- Develop insights that support simulation validation and future alloy design.

### Methods

- **Mechanical Processing**: Unidirectional cold rolling with 50% and 70% thickness reductions.
- **Microstructural Characterization**:
  - **Optical Microscopy** and **SEM** for surface morphology.
  - **EBSD** for local orientation and recrystallization analysis.
  - **X-ray Diffraction** for global texture quantification.
- **Mechanical Testing**: Microhardness mapping using Vickers hardness tester.

### Outcomes

This study offered fundamental insights into recrystallization mechanisms and texture development in cp-Ti—critical for tailoring formability and strength in commercial applications. It also served as a benchmark for validating simulations.
