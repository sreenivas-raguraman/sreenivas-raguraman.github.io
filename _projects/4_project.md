This NSF-funded project investigates the **role of excess vacancies** in driving solute clustering and precipitation in **magnesium** and **aluminum alloys**. These insights support the development of high-performance, lightweight materials for **structural** and **biomedical applications**.

Conducted in collaboration with  
**Prof. Michael Falk (JHU)**, **Dr. Arun Devaraj (PNNL)**, **Dr. Marc H Weber (WSU)**, and **Dr. Mark McLean (NIST)**, this project integrates advanced characterization with defect thermodynamics.

### Research Objectives

- Quantify **vacancy concentrations** generated by processing.
- Examine how vacancies influence **solute clustering** and **precipitation**.
- Understand fundamental thermodynamics of **vacancy–solute interactions**.

---

### Methodology

**Vacancy Manipulation:**
- Controlled quenching and deformation introduce tailored vacancy concentrations.

**Characterization Suite:**
- **Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy (PAS)** – quantifies vacancy concentration.
- **Atom Probe Tomography (APT)** – 3D mapping of solute cluster structures.
- **XRD & TEM** – validate phase formation and crystallographic structure.

**Systems Under Study:**
- **Mg Alloys:** Mg–Al, Mg–Zn, Mg–Y  
- **Al Alloys:** Al–Mg, Al–Ag, Al–Cu

**Mechanistic Insights:**
- Simulations and theory help correlate experimental data with clustering energetics.
