This project explores the effect of **thermomechanical processing routes**—including extrusion, ECAP, annealing, and solution treatments—on the **microstructure and performance** of **ZX10 magnesium alloys** for biodegradable implant applications.

Our aim is to optimize the **strength–corrosion trade-off**, enabling better material performance for biomedical usage. This project is conducted in collaboration with **Fort Wayne Metals**, a leader in biomaterials processing and manufacturing.
