	abstract = {Medical application materials must meet multiple requirements, and the designed material must mimic the structure, shape. and support the formation of the replacing tissue. Magnesium (Mg) and Zinc alloys (Zn), as a {\textquotedblleft}smart{\textquotedblright} biodegradable material and as {\textquotedblleft}the green engineering material in the 21st century{\textquotedblright}, have become an outstanding implant material due to their natural degradability, smart biocompatibility, and desirable mechanical properties. Magnesium and Zinc are recognized as the next generation of cardiovascular stents and bioresorbable scaffolds. At the same time, improving the properties and corrosion resistance of these alloys is an urgent challenge. particularly to promote the application of magnesium alloys. A relatively fast deterioration rate of magnesium-based materials generally results in premature mechanical integrity compromise and local hydrogen build-up, resulting in restricted applicability. This review article aims to give a comprehensive comparison between Zn-based alloys and Mg-based alloys, focusing primarily on degradation and biocompatibility for cardiovascular applications. The recent clinical trials using these biodegradable metals have also been addressed.},

	abstract = {The recrystallization behaviour of cold-rolled (CR) commercially pure (cp)-titanium was investigated by experiments and simulations. The recrystallization texture in cp-titanium depends upon the deformation texture. The main texture components of the lower deformed (50% CR) material are {1014} < 2131 >, {1013} < 2131 > and{1235} < 2311 >, all having weak intensity, and in the case of 70% cold rolling the texture component is {1013} < 3031 >. For the simulations, a parallel 3D cellular automata (CA) model for recrystallization was employed. The simulation results showed good agreement with the recrystallization kinetics, grain size distribution, microstructure and texture. The mechanism of recrystallization and the evolution of recrystallization texture were found to depend on the site of nucleation, i.e., whether it is formed at grain boundaries, within the grain, in the lath region or in the highly deformed region such as shear bands.},

	abstract = {Magnesium alloys are emerging as promising alternatives to traditional orthopedic implant materials thanks to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and impressive mechanical characteristics. However, their rapid in-vivo degradation presents challenges, notably in upholding mechanical integrity over time. This study investigates the impact of high-temperature thermal processing on the mechanical and degradation attributes of a lean Mg-Zn-Ca-Mn alloy, ZX10. Utilizing rapid, cost-efficient characterization methods like X-ray diffraction and optical microscopy, we swiftly examine microstructural changes post-thermal treatment. Employing Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, we unveil the relationship between microstructural properties and critical targets (properties): hardness and corrosion resistance. Additionally, leveraging the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we pinpoint the dominant microstructural factors among closely correlated variables. Our findings underscore the significant role of grain size refinement in strengthening and the predominance of the ternary Ca2Mg6Zn3 phase in corrosion behavior. This suggests that achieving an optimal blend of strength and corrosion resistance is attainable through fine grains and reduced concentration of ternary phases. This thorough investigation furnishes valuable insights into the intricate interplay of processing, structure, and properties in magnesium alloys, thereby advancing the development of superior biodegradable implant materials.},

	abstract = {Bone defects occur due to factors such as congenital anomaly, trauma, and osseous deficiency following resection of tumours. Biomaterials are required for bone augmentation of the lost bone architecture. Clinicians attempting to regenerate the tissue and restore its function and aesthetics because of trauma, pathology, or congenital defects face a substantial challenge. The concept of using metallic foam in bone tissue engineering is a key factor in the regeneration of critical size bone defects. Significant research efforts have been dedicated to the development of metallic foams for bone tissue engineering due to their suitable mechanical and biological properties. Although, at present, most of the studies are focused on non-load bearing materials, many materials are also being investigated for hard tissue repair. Several biocompatible metallic foam materials such as titanium alloys, tantalum, iron, zinc, and magnesium alloys have been commonly employed as implants in biomedical applications. They are often used to replace and regenerate the damaged bones or to provide structural support for healing bone defects. The bone cells develop on the porous regions of the implants. These cells develop over the surface of the foam, which imparts the integrity and strength. The scaffolds help in regeneration of the biological structural components of the extracellular matrix. This chapter focuses on the commonly used metallic foams for bone tissue engineering, their properties, applications, and cellular interactions.},

However, achieving a balance between mechanical strength and bio-corrosion resistance remains a critical challenge. This study systematically investigates the effects of three thermomechanical processing routes{\textemdash}extrusion (EXT), Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP), and ECAP followed by annealing at 150oC for 10 h (ECAP-A){\textemdash}on the ZX10 magnesium alloy. EXT produced coarse grains and moderate mechanical and corrosion performance. ECAP refined the grain structure and reduced the Mg2Ca phase, leading to an 80 \% increase in hardness, improved yield strength, and enhanced ductility, but at the cost of a doubled corrosion rate due to high dislocation density. ECAP-A mitigated this drawback, reducing the corrosion rate to 1.50 mm/year while maintaining a high yield strength ( {\textgreater} 200 MPa). This improvement was driven by a uniform distribution of the Ca2Mg6Zn3 phase, further dissolution of the Mg2Ca phase, and reduced dislocation density. These findings establish ECAP-A as an effective strategy to simultaneously optimize strength and bio-corrosion resistance, advancing the ZX10 magnesium alloy as a promising material for biodegradable implants.},

However, the rapid corrosion of Mg remains a challenge, necessitating a deeper understanding of its behavior in physiological environments. This study evaluates the in vitro corrosion performance of a lean Mg-Zn-Ca alloy processed via equal channel angular pressing to refine the grain size and enhance the mechanical properties. Corrosion behavior was assessed in Hank{\textquoteright}s balanced salt solution (HBSS), Earle{\textquoteright}s balanced salt solution (EBSS) buffered with 5\% \$\$\{{\textbackslash}hbox \{CO\}\}\_\{2\}\$\$ CO 2 , and Dulbecco{\textquoteright}s modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10\% fetal bovine serum (FBS) buffered with 5\% \$\$\{{\textbackslash}hbox \{CO\}\}\_\{2\}\$\$ CO 2 . Significant differences in corrosion rates were observed across media, with HBSS exhibiting the lowest rates and EBSS the highest. DMEM with 10\% FBS produced intermediate corrosion rates under conditions that closely mimic physiological environments. The effect of \$\$\{{\textbackslash}hbox \{CO\}\}\_\{2\}\$\$ CO 2 buffering in HBSS was also evaluated, demonstrating enhanced pH control below 7.5, which simulates physiological pH. Additionally, increasing the volume of HBSS, both with and without \$\$\{{\textbackslash}hbox \{CO\}\}\_\{2\}\$\$ CO 2 buffering, led to reduced corrosion rates and greater pH stabilization. These results demonstrate how testing conditions influence corrosion rates and pH stability, advancing our understanding of biodegradable Mg alloys for biomedical applications.},
